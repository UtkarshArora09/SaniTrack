# SaniTrack
SaniTrack is an AI-powered hospital sanitation monitoring system that integrates face detection (Haarcascade), KNN-based face recognition, and YOLOv8 trash detection to verify cleaner attendance and ward hygiene in real time. It triggers automated WhatsApp alerts for absenteeism or incomplete cleaning and enables admin task reassignment.
